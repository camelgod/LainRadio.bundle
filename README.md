# LainRadio.bundle

This is a Plex Media Server bundle for the lainon radio channel.

What this does is add a channel to your Plex server, get list of lainon channels, and finally make them available for streaming in your plex application.

**How do I install this?**

1. Extract and rename from "lainradio.bundle-master" to "LainRadio.bundle"
2. Move LainRadio.bundle to your plex plug-ins folder and restart server.

Directory should look like this:
(plexserver)\Plug-ins\LainRadio.bundle\Contents\


**Where is my Plex plugins folder?**
